## Week 1
   * [Lab notebook - Sept 4th](lectures/01_week_lab.ipynb)
   * [Lecture notebook - Sept 6th](lectures/01_week.ipynb)

## Week 2
 * [Lab notebook - Sept 11](lectures/02_week_lab.ipynb)
 * [numpy exercise](exercises/numpy_basics.ipynb)
 * A [playlist of several good short videos introducing different types of plots with matplotlib](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl5qPnqps8M&index=2&list=PLeo1K3hjS3uu4Lr8_kro2AqaO6CFYgKOl) 
This link skips the first video in the playlist because it talks about installation and you already have matplotlib installed via Anaconda.
 * Recommended [plotting exercise](exercises/plotting_basics.ipynb)
